# StudentScores

This code creates a dictionary called student_scores. The dictionary has five keys, which are the names of five students: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, and Neville. The values associated with the keys are the students' scores on a test.

Then it creates an empty dictionary called student_grades. This dictionary will be used to store the students' grades.

Then it loops through the student_scores dictionary. For each student, the code gets the student's score and then uses it to assign the student a grade. The grades are assigned based on the following criteria:

A score of 90 or above is an "Outstanding" grade.
A score of 81 to 89 is an "Exceeding Expectations" grade.
A score of 71 to 79 is an "Acceptable" grade.
A score of 70 or below is a "Fail" grade.

And finally it prints the student_grades dictionary.
